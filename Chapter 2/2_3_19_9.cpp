/* 2.3.9 The riddle (a bit of a tricky one)
Chris Wild

We think that now is a good time for a riddle. Of course, we don't expect you to solve the riddle. We want you to write a program that
will solve it.
Imagine a square built out of tiles. The size of its side (measured in the number of tiles) is always odd. For example, this is a square with
a side size equal to 3:
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
Now we're going to fill it with numbers. We always start from the very center tile and place a "1" in it. The next number is obviously "2"
and we place it above the center tile. The next number will be "3" and we put it to the right of "2".
Have you already guessed what we're doing? Yes, we're going to form a right-handed helix!
This is what our square will eventually look like:
+---+---+---+
| 9 | 2 | 3 |
+---+---+---+
| 8 | 1 | 4 |
+---+---+---+
| 7 | 6 | 5 |
+---+---+---+
Here's what we expect from you: write a code that accepts one integer number (it must be odd), treat it as the size of our "squared helix"
and find the number located in the bottom right tile (in our example it's 5).
Hint: there are many ways to find the answer â€“ some of them are better (shorter and faster), while some are worse (longer and slower).
The fact that you can use a loop doesn't mean that you have to use it. Think twice, use paper and pencil, do not rush. Better solutions
usually take time to find.
And, of course, test your code using the data we've provided.

    }
    else
    {
        // calculate number in bottom right corner
        result = number * number;   // get total squares in grid
        result -= number;   // subtract left column
        result -= number - 2;   // subract bottom row (except left and right corners)

/* Actual output (copied from console window)

Enter a positive odd number: -3
Your number must be an odd number, 1 or higher.

Enter a positive odd number: 0
Your number must be an odd number, 1 or higher.

Enter a positive odd number: 2
Your number must be an odd number, 1 or higher.

Enter a positive odd number: 3
The bottom right corner has the number 5

Enter a positive odd number: 5
The bottom right corner has the number 17

Enter a positive odd number: 11
The bottom right corner has the number 101

Enter a positive odd number: 11111
The bottom right corner has the number 123432101
