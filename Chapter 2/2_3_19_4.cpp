/* 2.3.4 Finding negative powers of 2
Chris Wild

Okay, positive powers of two are no longer a mystery, but we mustn't forget about the negative ones. They are as important as their
positive siblings. Let's remind ourselves of the basic rule:
	2^-n = 1 / 2^n

We want you to modify your previous program to make it able to evaluate negative powers of two.

Hint 1: use division instead of multiplication.

Hint 2: use a double to store the result – remember, you operate in fractions!

Hint 3: don't forget to add cout.precision(20); before printing the final result (unless you want to lose the most interesting part of the
value)

Test your code using the data we've provided.
